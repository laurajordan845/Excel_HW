This is the Module 2 Challenge Assignment for Laura Jordan


Description

This assignment includes creating a script that loops through all the stocks for 2018, 2019, and 2020 and provide outputs for the ticker symbols, yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price at the end of the year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price at the end of the year, and the total stock volume. 

Additionally, it color codes the Yearly Change and Percentage Change columns so you can easily see positive and negative changes in those values.

Lastly, this script provides a summary box noting the ticker symbol and value for the stock with the greatest increase percentage change, greatest decrease percentage change and the greatest total volume for each given year.
